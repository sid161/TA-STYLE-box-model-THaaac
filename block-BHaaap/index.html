2. After the heading, there should be a paragraph.
3. After the paragraph add an image having all the corner rounded.
4. Below the image, there should be a circle with red background.
5. At the bottom of the page, there must be a footer containing few links.
6. The H1 has 1px red solid borders, background color #D18C1D, and 10px of space between the content and the border (padding)
